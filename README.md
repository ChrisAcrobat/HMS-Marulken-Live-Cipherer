# Wolfpack: Live Cipherer
Live Cipherer is a fan-made tool written in [Java](https://www.java.com/download/) to use with the game [Wolfpack](http://wolfpackgame.com/) for crypting and decrypting messages faster.

## Download
Go [here](https://github.com/ChrisAcrobat/Wolfpack-Live-Cipherer/releases/latest/) to get the latest release of **Wolfpack: Live Cipherer** and download `Wolfpack-LiveCipherer.zip`.

## Project is ~~on hold.~~ _Alive!_
Now after three years of sleep and Wolfpack is released as early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/), I have now returned to this project.

The Live Cipherer is now compatible with the current version of Wolfpack (currently `Patch 0.14`), but I do expect the capability to change in the future because I think that the developers are aiming to implement some version of the Enigma's plugboard as well.

## Interactions
Discussions can be held in the [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/490920/discussions/0/1837937637905826469/) or [SubSim](http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=226415) forum, but if you find a problem or noticing any incompatibilities with Wolfpack's builtin Enigma, please do report them [here](https://github.com/ChrisAcrobat/Wolfpack-Live-Cipherer/issues/) as an issue!
