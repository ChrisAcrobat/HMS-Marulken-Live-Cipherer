# Wolfpack: Live Cipherer
A fan-made tool to use with the game [Wolfpack](http://wolfpackgame.com/) for crypting and decrypting messages faster.

## Project is ~~on hold.~~ _Alive!_
Now after three years of sleep and Wolfpack is released as early access on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/) ,I have now returned to this project. The Live Cipherer is now compatible with the current version of Wolfpack (currently `Patch 0.14`), but I do expect the capability to change in the future because I think that the developers are aiming to implement some version of the Enigma's plugboard as well.

If you find any problems or noticing some incompatibilities with Wolfpack's builtin Enigma, please do report it as an [issue](https://github.com/ChrisAcrobat/Wolfpack-Live-Cipherer/issues/)!
