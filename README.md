# Wolfpack: Live Cipherer
Live Cipherer is a fan-made tool written in HTML ([open page](https://chrisacrobat.github.io/Wolfpack-Live-Cipherer/)) to use with the game [Wolfpack](http://wolfpackgame.com/) for crypting and decrypting messages faster.

Current version of Live Cipherer is compatible with Wolfpack `Patch 0.22`, but I do expect the capability to change in the future because I think that the developers are aiming to implement some version of the Enigma's plugboard as well.

## Tip
If you want a minimalist window you can open Live Cipherer as a Chrome app by creating a shortcut to `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --app=https://ChrisAcrobat.github.io/Wolfpack-Live-Cipherer/LiveCipherer.html`.
